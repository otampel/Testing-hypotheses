# Testing-hypotheses

The purpose of the study is to identify the patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow us to bid on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.

## Project description (tasks)
### Data preprocessing
- convert data types
- convert the names of the columns to snakecase

### EDA
- check how many games were released each year
- check how sales have changed by platform
- determine the period of time that will help make the prognosis for 2017
- pick potentially profitable platforms

- the average user score of the Xbox One and PC platforms is the same
- the average user score of Action and Sports genres is the same
